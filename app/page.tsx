              <p>
                Casey, your post stood out because the role is not really one
                lane. It reads like product, GTM, community, systems, and taste
                all bleeding into each other.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is the kind of work I like. Build the thing, figure out
                who needs it, get it in front of them, learn from the reaction,
                and tighten the system.
              </p>
              <p>
                My read is that SuperMe does not just need someone to execute
                tasks. It needs someone who can notice where product quality,
                network quality, and go-to-market quality reinforce each other,
                then turn that into a weekly operating system.

              SuperMe gets stronger when the right professionals join, but only

              My read is that SuperMe is not competing with LinkedIn profiles.
              It is competing with the private doc, Slack thread, podcast clip,
              customer call, and founder note where someone's real expertise
              usually lives.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-8 text-ink">
              The wedge is not more profiles. The wedge is turning real
              professional judgment into something searchable, conversational,

              The hard part is not just recruiting impressive people. It is

              come back to.

              <p>I have been doing pieces of this already.</p>
              <p>
                At Circuit AI, I worked across product, demos, customer
                discovery, GTM workflows, and AI systems. With ProspectNav and
                SignalForce, I built systems for finding high intent people,
                scoring signals, and turning that into useful workflow
                infrastructure.

                The common thread has been translating messy external signals
                into something useful for a team: who to talk to, why now, what
                they care about, and what should happen next.
              </p>
              <p>
                SuperMe feels like the same kind of messy, high leverage
                problem. The product, network, community, and GTM motion are all
                connected. That is what makes it interesting.
